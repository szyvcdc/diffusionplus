## Updates

- **`[2026/25/02]`** LEAD is accepted to CVPR 2026! 🎉

- **`[2026/25/02]`** NAVSIM data pre-processing and training instructions released.
  > Supplementary data coming soon.

- **`[2026/02/02]`** Preliminary support for [Py123D](https://github.com/autonomousvision/py123d)
  > Added initial support for Py123D, enabling: collecting, loading and visualizing driving data in unified data format.

- **`[2026/01/18]`** Deactivated Kalman filter
  > By default, we deactivate the Kalman filter used for ego state estimation and GPS target-point smoothing to evaluate the policy in a fully end-to-end setting. While this may slightly reduce closed-loop performance, it avoids unrealistically noise-free target points. To turn the kalman filter on, set `use_kalman_filter=True` in [config_closed_loop.py](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py).

- **`[2026/01/13]`** CARLA dataset and training documentation released
  > We publicly release a CARLA dataset generated with the same pipeline as described in the paper. Note that due to subsequent refactoring and code cleanup, the released dataset differs from the original dataset used in our experiments. Performance on the new dataset is similar to the reported performance.

- **`[2026/01/05]`** Deactivated stop-sign heuristic
  > By default, we deactivate explicit stop-sign handling to evaluate the policy in a fully end-to-end setting. This may slightly reduce closed-loop performance compared to earlier runs.  To turn the heuristic on, set `slower_for_stop_sign=True` in [config_closed_loop.py](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py).

- **`[2026/01/05]`** RoutePlanner bug fix
  > Fixed an index error that caused the driving policy to crash at the end of routes in Town13. Driving scores have been updated accordingly.

- **`[2025/12/24]`** Initial release
  > Paper, checkpoints, expert driver, and inference code are now available.

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment initialization

Clone the repository and map the project root to your environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.git
cd lead

# Setup environment, important!
echo -e "export LEAD_PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc  # Set project root variable
echo "source $(pwd)/scripts/main.sh" >> ~/.bashrc       # Persist more environment variables
source ~/.bashrc                                        # Reload config
```

Please verify that `~/.bashrc` reflects these paths correctly.

### 2. Install dependencies

We utilize [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install), conda-lock and uv:

```bash
# Install conda-lock and create conda environment
pip install conda-lock && conda-lock install -n lead conda-lock.yml

# Activate conda environment
conda activate lead

# Install dependencies and setup git hooks
pip install uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && uv pip install -e .

# Install other tools needed for development
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg parallel tree gcc zip unzip

# Optional: Activate git hooks
pre-commit install
```

While waiting for dependencies installation, we recommend setting up CARLA and downloading checkpoints on parallel:

```bash
# Download and setup CARLA at 3rd_party/CARLA_0915
bash scripts/setup_carla.sh
```

### 3. Download checkpoints

Pre-trained checkpoints are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ln2697/tfv6) for reproducibility. These checkpoints follow the TFv6 architecture, but differ in their sensor configurations, vision backbones or dataset composition.

</div>

To download checkpoints:

```bash
# Either download one for test purpose
bash scripts/download_one_checkpoint.sh

# Or clone them all (>10GB)
git clone https://huggingface.co/ln2697/tfv6 outputs/checkpoints
cd outputs/checkpoints
git lfs pull
```

### 4. Setup VSCode/PyCharm

For VSCode, install recommended extensions when prompted. We support debugging of data collection, training and evaluation out of the box.

![](docs/assets/vscode.png)

For PyCharm, you need to add CARLA Python API `3rd_party/CARLA_0915/PythonAPI/carla` to your Python path `Settings... → Python → Interpreter → Show All... → Show Interpreter Paths`.

![](docs/assets/pycharm.png)


### 5. Evaluate model

To initiate closed-loop evaluation and verify the setup, execute the following:

```bash
# Start driving environment
bash scripts/start_carla.sh

# Start policy on one route
python lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/tfv6_resnet34 \
  --routes data/benchmark_routes/bench2drive/23687.xml \
  --bench2drive
```

Driving logs will be saved to <code>outputs/local_evaluation</code> with the following structure:

```html
outputs/local_evaluation/1_town15_construction
├── 1_town15_construction_debug.mp4
├── 1_town15_construction_demo.mp4
├── 1_town15_construction_input.mp4
├── checkpoint_endpoint.json
├── debug_images
├── demo_images
├── input_images
├── input_log
├── infractions.json
├── metric_info.json
└── qualitative_results.mp4
```
Launch the interactive infraction dashboard to analyze driving failures more conveniently:

```bash
python lead/infraction_webapp/app.py
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/?dir=outputs%2Flocal_evaluation), fill the input field with `outputs/local_evaluation` to access the infraction dashboard, useful for analyzing large-scale evaluations

</div>

> [!TIP]
> 1. Disable video recording in [config_closed_loop](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py) by turning off `produce_demo_video` and `produce_debug_video`.
> 2. If memory is limited, modify the file prefixes to load only the first checkpoint seed. By default, the pipeline loads all three seeds as an ensemble.
> 3. To save time, decrease video FPS in [config_closed_loop](lead/inference/config_closed_loop.py) by increasing `produce_frame_frequency`.

## Training

For a more detailed documentation, take a look at the [documentation page](https://ln2697.github.io/lead/docs/carla_training.html). First, download the CARLA dataset from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ln2697/lead_carla) using git lfs:

```bash
# Download all routes
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/ln2697/lead_carla data/carla_leaderboard2/zip
cd data/carla_leaderboard2/zip
git lfs pull

# Or download a single route for testing
bash scripts/download_one_route.sh

# Upzip the routes
bash scripts/unzip_routes.sh

# Build data cache
python scripts/build_cache.py
```

Start pretraining:

```bash
# Train on a single GPU
python3 lead/training/train.py \
  logdir=outputs/local_training/pretrain

# Or Torch DDP
bash scripts/pretrain_ddp.sh
```

Training logs and checkpoints will be saved to `outputs/local_training/pretrain`. To fine-tune the pretrained model with planning decoder enabled:

```bash
# Single GPU
python3 lead/training/train.py \
  logdir=outputs/local_training/posttrain \
  load_file=outputs/local_training/pretrain/model_0030.pth \
  use_planning_decoder=true

# Distributed Torch DDP
bash scripts/posttrain_ddp.sh
```

Post-training checkpoints will be saved to `outputs/local_training/posttrain`.

For distributed training on SLURM, see this [documentation page](https://ln2697.github.io/lead/docs/slurm_training.html). For a complete SLURM workflow of pre-training, post-training, evaluation, see this [example](slurm/experiments/001_example).

## Data Collection

To collect your own dataset, you can run the rule-based expert driver. To setup own camera/lidar/radar calibration, see [config_base.py](lead/common/config_base.py) and [config_expert.py](lead/expert/config_expert.py).

```bash
# Start CARLA
bash scripts/start_carla.sh

# Collect Data Alternative 1
python lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
  --expert \
  --routes data/data_routes/lead/noScenarios/short_route.xml

# Collect Data Alternative 2
bash scripts/eval_expert.sh

# Collect Data 123D Format Alternative 1
export LEAD_EXPERT_CONFIG="target_dataset=6 py123d_data_format=true use_radars=false lidar_stack_size=2 save_only_non_ground_lidar=false save_lidar_only_inside_bev=false"
python -u $LEAD_PROJECT_ROOT/lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
    --expert \
    --py123d \
    --routes data/data_routes/50x38_Town12/ParkingCrossingPedestrian/3250_1.xml

# Collect Data 123D Format Alternative 2
bash scripts/eval_expert_123d.sh
```
Collected data will be saved to `outputs/expert_evaluation/` with the following sensor outputs:


```html
├── bboxes/                  # Per-frame 3D bounding boxes for all actors
├── depth/                   # Compressed and quantized depth maps

## Benchmarking

For a more detailed documentation, take a look at the [evaluation documentation](https://ln2697.github.io/lead/docs/evaluation.html).

```bash
# Start CARLA
bash scripts/start_carla.sh

# Bench2Drive Alternative 1
python lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/tfv6_resnet34 \
  --routes data/benchmark_routes/bench2drive/23687.xml \
  --bench2drive

# Bench2Drive Alternative 2
bash scripts/eval_bench2drive.sh

# Longest6 v2 Alternative 1
python lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/tfv6_resnet34 \
  --routes data/benchmark_routes/longest6/00.xml

# Longest6 v2 Alternative 2
bash scripts/eval_longest6.sh

# Town13 Alternative 1
python lead/leaderboard_wrapper.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/tfv6_resnet34 \
  --routes data/benchmark_routes/Town13/0.xml

# Town13 Alternative 2
bash scripts/eval_town13.sh

# Clean CARLA
bash scripts/clean_carla.sh
```

Results will be saved to `outputs/local_evaluation/` with videos, infractions, and metrics. For distributed evaluation across multiple routes and benchmarks, see the [SLURM evaluation documentation](https://ln2697.github.io/lead/docs/slurm_evaluation.html). For large-scale evaluation we also provide a WandB logger.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **`lead`** - Main Python package containing model architecture, training, inference, and expert driver
- **`3rd_party`** - Third-party dependencies (CARLA, benchmarks, evaluation tools)
- **`data`** - Route definitions for training and evaluation. Sensor data will also be stored here.
- **`scripts`** - Utility scripts for data processing, training, and evaluation
- **`outputs`** - Model checkpoints, evaluation results, and visualizations
- **`notebooks`** - Jupyter notebooks for data inspection and analysis
- **`slurm`** - SLURM job scripts for large-scale experiments

For a detailed breakdown of the codebase organization, see the [project structure documentation](https://ln2697.github.io/lead/docs/project_structure.html).

## Common Issues

Most issues can be solved by:
- Delete and rebuild training cache / buckets.
- Restart CARLA simulator.

When debugging policy / expert, the script `scripts/reset_carla_world.py` can be handy to reset the current map without restarting the simulator. The latter can time-costly, especially on larger maps.

## Beyond CARLA: Cross-Benchmark Deployment

The LEAD pipeline and TFv6 models are deployed as **reference implementations and benchmark entries** across multiple autonomous driving simulators and evaluation suites:

* **[Waymo Vision-based End-to-End Driving Challenge (DiffusionLTF)](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2025/e2e-driving/)**
  Strong baseline entry for the inaugural end-to-end driving challenge hosted by Waymo, achieving **2nd place** in the final leaderboard.

* **[NAVSIM v1 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2024-P/e2e-driving-navtest)**
  Latent TransFuser v6 is an updated reference baseline for the `navtest` split, improving PDMS by +3 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, used to evaluate navigation and control under diverse driving conditions.

* **[NAVSIM v2 (LTFv6)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AGC2025/e2e-driving-navhard)**
  The same Latent TransFuser v6 improves EPMDS by +6 points over the Latent TransFuser baseline, targeting distribution shift and scenario complexity.

* **[NVIDIA AlpaSim Simulator (TransFuserModel)](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpasim)**
  Adapting the NAVSIM's Latent TransFuser v6 checkpoints, AlpaSim also features an official TransFuser driver, serving as a baseline policy for closed-loop simulation.
